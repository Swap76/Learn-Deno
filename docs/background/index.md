## Why Deno? Is it needed?

Deno was announced almost 2 years ago by the Node.js original creator Ryan Dahl at JSConf EU. Watch the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA) of the talk, it’s very interesting and it’s a mandatory watch if you are involved in Node.js and JavaScript in general.

Every project manager must take decisions. Ryan regretted some early decisions in Node. Also, technology evolves, and today JavaScript is a totally different language than what it was back in 2009 when Node started. Think about the modern ES6/2016/2017 features, and so on.

So he started a new project to create some sort of second wave of JavaScript-powered server side apps.

## Will it replace Node.js?

No. Node.js is a giant, well established, incredibly well supported technology that is going to stay for decades.
