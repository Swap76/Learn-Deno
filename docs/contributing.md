# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the changes you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository then only work on making changes.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure every pull request is done with a respective issue mentioned in the description.
2. If in the folder only one file is present name it `index.md` this will avoid the problem of thinking of names & can help us minimize repetition.
3. Use camel casing for folder names & use `-` instead of `_`. Ex. `file-server.md` is correct but, `file_server.md` is wrong.
4. In the pull request description mention all changes mainly the braking ones.
