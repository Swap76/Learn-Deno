## Deno Standard Libraries

These modules do not have external dependencies and they are reviewed by the Deno core team. The intention is to have a standard set of high quality code that all Deno projects can use fearlessly.

## How to use

These modules are tagged in accordance with Deno releases. So, for example, the v0.53.0 tag is guaranteed to work with deno v0.53.0. You can link to v0.53.0 using the URL https://deno.land/std@v0.53.0/. Not specifying a tag will link to the master branch.

It is strongly recommended that you link to tagged releases to avoid unintended updates.
